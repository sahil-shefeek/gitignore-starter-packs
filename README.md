<div align="center"><h1> gitignore starter packs âœ§</h1></div>


Combined `.gitignore` templates for a comprehensive project starter. This repository includes popular programming languages such as C, C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, Dart, Go, and many more. 
> These templates are designed to help developers quickly set up a `.gitignore` file tailored to their specific project needs, ensuring that unnecessary files are not tracked in version control.

## How do i use this?

To use these `.gitignore` templates:

1. **Choose the Template**: Browse through the repository and select the `.gitignore` file(s) that match the languages or frameworks used in your project.
> For example:
>   - Use the **Python** template for Django or Django REST framework projects.
>   - Use the **JavaScript** template for web-based projects involving Node.js, React, or Vue.js.
>   - For a Flutter project, use the **Dart** template.

3. **Combine Templates if Needed**: If your project is full-stack or uses multiple languages, feel free to combine multiple `.gitignore` files. Simply copy the contents from each relevant file and paste them into a single `.gitignore` file for your project.

4. **Customize**: Modify the `.gitignore` file as needed to better suit the specifics of your project.
